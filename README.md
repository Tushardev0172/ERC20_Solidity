# ERC20 Token 
This project demonstrates the implementation of an ERC20 token contract using Solidity. The ERC20 token standard defines a set of functions and events that an Ethereum token contract must implement in order to be considered ERC20 compliant. 

It consists of two Solidity files: IERC20.sol and ERC20.sol.



## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Ethereum and Solidity programming language.
- Ethereum development environment set up (e.g., Ethereum client, such as Ganache, and Solidity compiler, such as Solidity Remix).
## Files
This project includes the following Solidity files:
- IERC20.sol
The IERC20.sol file contains the interface definition for the ERC20 token. It specifies the functions and events that must be implemented by any ERC20-compliant token. The interface includes functions such as totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, and approve.
- ERC20.sol
The ERC20.sol file implements the ERC20 token contract. It defines the functions and events specified in the IERC20.sol interface. This contract provides the logic for token transfers, approvals, and balance tracking. It also includes additional functions such as name, symbol, and decimals to provide information about the token.
## Getting Started
- Open the ERC20.sol file in a Solidity editor (e.g., Solidity Remix).

- Compile the contract to ensure there are no compilation errors.

- Deploy the contract to an Ethereum development network (e.g., Ganache) using your preferred Ethereum client.

- Interact with the deployed ERC20 token contract by using the provided functions.
## ERC20 Token 
The ERC20 token is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of functions and events that must be implemented by any ERC20-compliant token.

The ERC20 token provides the following functionalities:
- name(): Returns the name of the token.
- symbol(): Returns the symbol of the token.
- decimals(): Returns the number of decimals the token uses.
- totalSupply(): Returns the total supply of the token.
- balanceOf(address): Returns the balance of the specified address.
- transfer(address, uint256): Transfers tokens from the sender's account to the specified address.
- approve(address, uint256): Approves the specified address to spend the sender's tokens.
- allowance(address, address): Returns the amount of tokens approved for the specified address to spend from the owner's account.
- transferFrom(address, address, uint256): Transfers tokens from one address to another if allowed by the owner.
Please refer to the IERC20.sol and ERC20.sol file for the complete implementation and documentation of the ERC20 token contract.

## Customization
You can customize the ERC20 token contract according to your specific requirements. You can modify the contract name, symbol, total supply, and any additional functionality you may need. Additionally, you can extend the contract to add your own custom features or implement additional standards on top of ERC20.
## Testing
It is recommended to thoroughly test the ERC20 token contract before deploying it to the main Ethereum network. You can write unit tests using a testing framework such as Truffle or Hardhat, and execute the tests against a local or virtual Ethereum network.
